# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering & PCA
**Project Overview:**  
This project focuses on customer segmentation through K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). By analyzing customer behavioral data, the goal is to group customers into distinct segments to identify key patterns and insights. These insights can help businesses develop targeted marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and boost revenue.

The project takes raw customer data, processes it, and applies machine learning techniques to create actionable insights. The segmentation is based on various customer attributes like balance, credit limit, tenure, and purchase behaviors, allowing businesses to better understand their customers.

**Tech Stack:**
Python for data processing and machine learning
Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
Seaborn & Matplotlib for data visualization
Scikit-learn for K-Means Clustering & PCA
Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab for development and analysis

**Key Features:**
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, scales the data, and removes irrelevant features to prepare for clustering.
K-Means Clustering: Uses the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters and provides insights on customer groupings.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduces data dimensionality while retaining 95% of the variance, allowing for more efficient clustering.
Cluster Profiling: Provides detailed profiles for each customer segment, helping businesses understand the characteristics of their high-value and low-engagement customers.
Marketing Strategy Recommendations: Based on customer segments, targeted marketing strategies are suggested to maximize engagement and profitability.

**How It Works:**
Data Exploration & Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and analyzed for any missing or irrelevant data points. Key features like balance, purchases, credit limit, and tenure are explored.
Clustering Analysis: The K-Means algorithm is applied to group customers into clusters, with the optimal number of clusters being chosen based on the elbow method.
Dimensionality Reduction: PCA is used to reduce the dataset's dimensionality while preserving the majority of the variance.
Customer Segmentation: The clusters are analyzed and profiled to highlight different customer behaviors, such as high spenders or long-term customers.
Actionable Insights: For each customer segment, personalized marketing strategies are recommended based on their behaviors and attributes.

**Potential Use Cases:**
Targeted Marketing: Tailor campaigns to different customer segments, from premium customers to those needing engagement incentives.
Customer Retention: Identify long-term customers and offer loyalty programs to keep them engaged.
Revenue Growth: Focus high-value offers on customers who are likely to spend more based on their segment profile.

**How to Run the Project:**

**Clone the repository:** git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation-clustering.git

**Install the required libraries:** pip install -r requirements.txt

**Conclusion:**
This project provides businesses with powerful insights into customer behavior, enabling data-driven marketing decisions. By segmenting customers and tailoring strategies to each group, companies can enhance their customer relationships and drive revenue growth.
